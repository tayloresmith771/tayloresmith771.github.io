   <h1>Welcome to Taylor's Programming Portfolio!</h1>
   <p>My name is Taylor Smith. This website was written myself using the HTML and CSS languages. It is intended to showcase my portfolio of programs
    that I've created for my CSC106 class at the University of Rhode Island. Above you can access the <em>"Javascripts"</em> button which will take you to the
    Javascripts I've created, as well as the <em>"About Me"</em> button to learn more about me.</p>
